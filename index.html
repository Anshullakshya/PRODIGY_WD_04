                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a highly skilled professional with a strong background in computer applications. I hold a Bachelor of Computer Applications from the Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, and am currently pursuing a Master of Computer Applications at Ajeenkya DY Patil University. My journey in technology has equipped me with expertise across various areas such as front-end and back-end development, cyber-security management, and responsive web design.

                    Through a free, self-paced Front-End Development course, I gained a solid foundation in CSS and mastered various aspects of web design. As a back-end engineer, I have a proven track record in optimizing systems, managing databases, and enhancing software performance, with significant contributions to projects such as those at Lyft.
                    
                    In cyber-security management, my hands-on experience includes identifying and mitigating cyber threats, and I excel at analyzing network traffic and potential security breaches. Additionally, my proficiency in HTML attributes and tags has enabled me to create well-structured web pages with diverse content elements.
                    
                    My comprehensive course in building responsive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap has further refined my skills in developing visually appealing, user-friendly interfaces. I am dedicated to leveraging my diverse skill set and passion for technology to contribute meaningfully to the world of web and software development.
